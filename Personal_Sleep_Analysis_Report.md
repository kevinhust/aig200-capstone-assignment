## 2. Professional Summary
Your overall sleep score is **68.6**, placing you in the **Fair** quality tier. While your total sleep duration (nearly 8 hours) is excellent, the quality is hampered by a relatively low percentage of deep sleep and a high number of awakenings/fragmentations. This suggests that while you are giving yourself enough time in bed, the "efficiency" of that sleep could be improved to better support physical body repair.

## 3. Actionable Recommendations
1.  **Optimize Deep Sleep**: Avoid caffeine and heavy meals at least 4-6 hours before bedtime.
2.  **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent wake-up time even on weekends to stabilize your circadian rhythm.
3.  **Environment**: Ensure your sleeping environment is cool, dark, and quiet to reduce the number of micro-awakenings.
4.  **Before Bed**: Reduce blue light exposure (phones/TV) for at least 1 hour before sleep to help natural melatonin production.
